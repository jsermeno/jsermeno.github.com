&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Game Design and The Ideal World&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t believe that people ask &lt;strong&gt;why&lt;/strong&gt; people play games often enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is an extensive amount of material related to game design on the internet. Most of this material I have found falls broadly into one of two categories. The first category is bullet-point lists. These typically are one-size fits all recommendations based on observations from a successful game. These can be useful. We should always study and learn from the successes and failures around us. However, general recommendations usually fail to capture the complicated context in which they apply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second category is more useful and consists of in depth analysis about &lt;strong&gt;what&lt;/strong&gt; design should be like, and how we can further improve the gaming experience for users. I personally want games to be of benefit to players, and find myself in disagreement with many of the mechanics that make it into today&amp;#39;s casual social games. However, much of the material that falls into this category fails to account for both what gamers consider a good game and why so many people also love casual social games. The explanation is often that casual social games are just plain manipulative. They are. But maybe there is something deeper that explains why people play these games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Why of Game Design&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need a new theory on game design that goes further than Minecraft good, Farmville bad. My view is that games are ultimately a reflection of the ideal world. Games fill some void that is present in reality and at any given time the perfect game allows a person to live the life they really want to live.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might be thinking, &lt;span class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Wait a minute! I don&amp;#39;t want to be pig farmer! And if you&amp;#39;re right I&amp;#39;ll just create a game where you have infinite fame and money and kill all enemies with the flick of a wrist. Muahahaha...&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--***--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People are more complex than that. The perfect world is not full of rainbows and lollipops where nothing goes wrong. That type of world may be fun for a short while, but I bet that most people would quickly become bored. Similarly, the ideal world for a person may have very little to do with their profession and surroundings. Although, I must admit that my favorite games have some sort of fantasy theme where I can beat down monsters with swords and magic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what is the ideal world? What life attributes are necessary for a person to be upon and their deathbed and confidently say that they led a life fulfilled and satisfied? It&amp;#39;s likely different for each and every person. However, there are certain qualities that many seek in their professional and personal lives that all common among the best games. I&amp;#39;ll update this list as I come across more qualities. For now, I believe that every human strives for challenge, progression, understanding, freedom, and socialization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Challenge&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Challenge is one of the most obvious aspects to any game. Even in the most vapid and humdrum games you must endure the mental challenge of patience. Otherwise the game would end instanteously. The challenge can also take on many other forms. It could be figuring out where to go next, solving a puzzle, finding out how fast you can button mash, or showing emotional resilience in the game that kills you 70 times a minute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People &lt;strong&gt;need&lt;/strong&gt; challenge. Maybe not 24/7. But, whether it is due to evolution, divine will, coded into our genes, or all three, people need challenge. Without a challenge you get boredom. Johnathan Blow, the creator of braid, said in one of his talks:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boredom is a healthy response to unproductive situations... Boredom has survival value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He was talking about how social games manipulate people into overcoming their natural survival instincts. If boredom has survival value it is to point people towards a challenge. That is why humans keep advancing and surviving. Because we need a challenge. If you cannot get your challenge in the real world, then perhaps you would turn to games. Now, challenge is not something that everybody is missing from their lives. It is however, linked to our next quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Progression&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the quality probably most associated with gamificiation, social games, and familiar to all gamers. You beat a level to get to the next level, or you kill monsters to gain experience points, or you get more stuff to add to your house. This is a reflection of real-life. People go to school to increase their grade. Seniors are always cooler than Freshman. People get a degree, maybe two, to prove their qualifications and to gain more knowledge. People work to get a bigger salary, faster cars, and a bigger house (or a house at all).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not everybody makes progress in life. Or maybe not in the way they expect themselves to. A housewife that feels stuck in life might gain solace with the occasional Candycrush and Farmville because they can always get better. They can always improve their skill, or gain better decorations. Maybe you&amp;#39;re doing just fine in life and you just want to make more progress crushing some n00bs in Starcraft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That last paragraph was kind of a downer now that I wrote it, but I think it&amp;#39;s necessary to examine why games are attractive. On to the next quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Understanding&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world is a complex and complicated place. Interactions can have ripple effects that make it seem like things just happen for no reason. Philosophers and religion have been trying to explain the world for thousands of years. Even with as much as we have learned there is just so much missing. Why are we here? What is our purpose in life? Will choosing bacon, steak, or both for dinner have profound unknown effects that cause the world to end in fifty years? I just don&amp;#39;t know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Games offer a much simpler world. In Mario if you get hit by an enemy or fall in a hole you die. If you get a powerup it has a deterministic bonus that helps you kill baddies. If you reach the end of the level you win. Even in a more complex rpg scenario the world is easy to understand. These stats effect my damage this much. I have an x% chance of evading an attack. If I get these items with these stats I can maximize the amount of damage I can inflict while still surviving assuming the enemies dps is exactly this much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This also explains why players just don&amp;#39;t care for extremely complicated simulation effects. They just don&amp;#39;t understand them, and therefore they don&amp;#39;t contribute to their play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Freedom&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes people want to do whatever the heck they want to. In the real world your freedom is restricted by many things. It could be that your freedom is restricted by money, social obligations, or even family obligations. We also have many rules in place. Most of them for good reason, in order to maintain a society that can flourish and thrive. For example, there are good rules in place that prevent you from dual-wielding poison infused daggers and ganking somebody when they least expect it. Even further, people are restricted by what is actually possible with our current technology. I can&amp;#39;t fly un-aided through a snowy mountain range.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Games provide a way to experience what it might be like to circumvent all of these restrictions. In some ways being able to magically gain money by killing a creature is a form of freedom. You can become a goblin rampaging through the hills. You can experience fantastic worlds made of candy and chocolate. One of the most popular games to exemplify this quality is Minecraft. By now most everybody has heard of Minecraft, and on mobile it&amp;#39;s less popular Survivalcraft clone. It&amp;#39;s a voxel-based game that let&amp;#39;s you build anything you can image out of blocks. It&amp;#39;s a great expression of freedom and allows the player to do things they could never imagine in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Socialization&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not all games satisfy this quality, but on some level or another everybody requires or desires some sort of interaction with other people. Even if you imagine yourself to be an introvert, spending a month in absolute seclusion can drive a man mad. Before the internet, games could be played together as a way to pass the time, laugh, or get to know somebody better. Since the invention of the internet, people have been able to more or less the same without being in the same room. This makes some people cringe, and evokes images of a computer nerd sitting in the dark pretending to be a girl over the internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like many things in the world there are pros and cons. It could give you a chance to interact with real-life friends that are too far away to visit on a daily basis. When I was a teenager I had a friend that I moved away from. We kept in touch by playing Dark Age of Camelot over the internet. For those of you that are not familiar with the game it&amp;#39;s an mmorpg that both preceded and is very similar to WoW. We would be on Ventrilo talking over our mics as we went on a raid, or did some PvP. It was pretty fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might even be able to make the argument that someone could build leadership skills in a mmorpg. Hear me out here. I&amp;#39;m not saying that someone who has played an mmorpg can go and lead a company. Not even close. However organizing people, recuiting people, convincing them to follow a purpose, like the leader of a guild would do, certainly has its merits. Especially if that person wouldn&amp;#39;t be exposed to those experiences otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully, I have presented enough loose evidence to support that the qualities of challenge, progression, understanding, freedom, and socialization are all qualities that we look for in our everyday lives. When we aren&amp;#39;t able to satisfy these qualities it&amp;#39;s possible that we use games as an outlet to fulfill that missing satisfaction. This does not meaning getting sucked into a game and losing yourself. It could. It could also mean just relieving a little stress with thirty minutes of play. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not trying to argue whether some games are good or bad. By understanding why people play games it provides a better starting point for how you construct your games. Also understand that manipulation in itself is not bad. It has just received a negative connotation over time. Manipulation is just understanding the underlying mechanics that affect behaviour and optimizing for a desired goal. The goal you aim for is what makes a valiant or devious effort. There is no reason to prevent putting eye candy into a game because it&amp;#39;s manipulative if you&amp;#39;re optimizing for a better experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next time you see some horrible social game that you hate get really popular, you shouldn&amp;#39;t rage and be like, &lt;span class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Argh! They&amp;#39;re ruining games!&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;. You should give thought to why that game became popular in the first place. I don&amp;#39;t mean copying elements from that game and putting it into your game. Really ask yourself, &lt;span class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Why?&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;. It could be because it fulfilled the basic qualities of life that we need in order to be satisfied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Phew, that was a long post. This blog is supposed to be about one man&amp;#39;s journey to create a mobile indie game. I thought I&amp;#39;d start by giving my thoughts on game design and why people play games. I don&amp;#39;t expect every post to be this long. Thank you if you stuck with it. I&amp;#39;d love to hear your thoughts in the comments even if you think I&amp;#39;m horribly wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
