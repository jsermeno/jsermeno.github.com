<p class="start_block">I’ve been thinking a lot lately about what makes a good product, and how it relates to creating a good business. Recently, I read the article <a href="">Design doesn’t deserve a seat at the table</a>. It is an interesting article about who should be involved in the direction that leads to a successful business, but something just didn’t sit right with me. </p>

<p>For all I know it was written specifically to be controversial. But I’ll bite, in case people start to believe the article. Ironically, it is written by a product designer. I’ve dabbled in product management, but I am most certainly an engineer by trade. I want to defend why design does deserve a seat at the table.</p>

<p>The article speaks to two types of value. Real value and perceived value. The claim is that design can multiply real value, and create perceived value. However, it cannot create real value, and a business cannot survive without real value. One key point he mentions during that section of the article is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Design can multiply utility that already exists, as it certainly did with the iPhone, but design isn’t the hero.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Therefore designers should not be given the power to be a part of business decisions. I believe there are some fundamental disconnects that could lead to this conclusion. So I’ll look at these first, before addressing the individual arguments in the article.</p>

<h3 id="what-qualifies-as-a-designer">What qualifies as a designer?</h3>

<p>All to often, design and UI are conflated. UI design is a part of design. It is not design’s sole purpose. In software, the main areas of design are UI design, interaction design, and experience design. In order to avoid a detailed definition of each one, let’s approximate the difference as beauty vs utility. UI design and experience design contribute to beauty, and interaction design and experience design contribute to utility. If I were to hire someone as a designer they would need all three skillsets. An artist, therefore is not a designer.</p>

<h3 id="technology-and-design-the-chicken-and-egg">Technology and Design: The chicken and egg</h3>

<p>Imagine the invention of an algorithm that can find the answer to the human existence, but on current hardware it will take one trillion years to finish. If we wait one thousand years hardware will be powerful enough to finish the computations in only one million years. For the next one thousand years the technology to find the answer to the human existence is essentially useless. Now image a beautiful painting. Let’s say Monet’s Water Lilies.</p>

<p class="date">- Apr 19, 2014-</p>

<p class="start_block">People often wonder what they should learn in life with respect to their career and goals. I’d like to offer one rather broad approach. </p>

<p>The internet offers an explosion of information. More than any one (wo)man could ever learn within a lifetime. It also offers more opportunity to learn than ever before. There just is <em>no</em> reason why someone cannot pursue a field that interests them anymore. This is especially true in software and tech. I’ve been told that some people are not capable enough. However, the only limitation is one’s own motivation. People who know me, know that I’m the last person to have unconditional faith in the human race. And this is something even <em>I</em>, believe that anyone can do.</p>

<p>Then what should you learn? You could ask what the most popular language is currently. There are people who have made careers solely as Java developers. Some of them are very good at what they do. Traditionally, broad spectrum knowledge indicates that specialists are good at large companies, and generalists are good at small startups. </p>

<p>I want to debunk this myth. In any situation, being exposed to only a single source of information can be dangeorous. Those that are accepting of new ideas prosper. Those that are set in their ways stagnate. The world is constantly changing, and you need to too.</p>

<h3 id="software-engineering-specialization">Software Engineering Specialization</h3>

<p>The same idea applies to learning how to be a software engineer. Every community around a single programming language has a set of best practices, and beliefs that they hold dear. Certain design patterns are more popular in one language than another. Different languages use different concurrency models, programming paradigms, type systems, data structures, and on and on. Learning a language from each programming paradigm will expand your toolbox, expose you to methodology pros and cons, and end up making you a better programmer in your first language than you were before.</p>

<p class="date">- Apr 14, 2014 -</p>

<p class="start_block">I wanted some Voronoi noise generated from Erlang. I needed to know how I should generate the noise, and what the most efficient way of doing this from Erlang was. I knew about Erlang NIFs already (Native Implemented Function). I was already using several through third party libraries. What I did not know is if I needed a NIF. </p>

<p>If Erlang could get the job done, then using a NIF would be overkill. In order to help with future decisions, I first implemented a Voronoi noise algorithm in Erlang, then as a C NIF, then as a C Port. I measured the performance at each step of the way. Who knows, the communication overhead with C could be more expensive than the operation itself. I’ve experienced this before with V8, and JNI bindings.</p>

<h2 id="voronoi-noise">Voronoi Noise</h2>

<p>Voronoi noise is also called Worley noise. It creates these polygon-like patterns like the ones in the header image of this blog post. There are several algorithms for Voronoi noise in existence. I chose Steven Worley’s algorithm. I had the special case of wanting infinite Voronoi Noise, and it did not look like Fortune’s algorithm could support that. The added bonus is that the algorithm is simple.</p>

<p>I won’t go into too much depth about how the algorithm works. There are many articles on this topic, such as <a href="http://aftbit.com/cell-noise-2/">here</a>. The basic idea is that the noise is generated in chunks. Each chunk randomly generates a number of points based on a poisson distribution. You also need to know the points for all neighboring chunks. Then at each pixel value, you calculate the distance to the closest point.</p>

<h2 id="erlang-implementation">Erlang Implementation</h2>

<p>For the Erlang implementation I first used arrays. Arrays in Erlang are supposed to have much more efficient random access than lists. It wasn’t until after I implemented the algorithm that I realized I could get away with sequential access. In which case, lists would have been much better. Good news, I implemented both. We can compare.</p>

<p class="start_block">Programmers program errors. You need to handle errors. Every major language has constructs for handling errors. Two guidelines that many try to follow are defensive programming, and fail-fast programming. The problems are that everyone has a different definition, and our choice of error handling should depend on our goals. </p>

<p>I want to take a look at what each method means, and how they should be used. I’ll also try to examine each method from the perspective of multiple languages.</p>

<p>First, we need to define how we want our program will behave. In 2014 users have strong expections of their programs. The internet has created an <em>always on</em> environment. Programs should always work. Users will not tolerate status 500 server error pages. They do not want cryptic error messages. This means no crashing. When a user is expecting a response from the program, errors should be handled gracefully. Make the user aware an error occured, then keep on chugging. We want to fix errors fast. So, we need to be aware of when they occur. If we can achieve all these goals, then we’ll be using <em>user focused programming</em>. Let’s look at defensive programming first.</p>

<h2 id="defensive-programming">Defensive Programming</h2>

<p>Some people hate it. Some people love it. If you hate it, it may be because people are misusing it and claiming glory in the name of defensive programming. In theory it basically means this.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Defend against the impossible, because the impossible will happen <a href="#fn:1">[1]</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In practice is applies to a broad smorgasbord of things. It means doing whatever it takes to prevent the application from crashing. It mostly applies to validating function arguments, and using one-size fits all syntax.</p>

<h3 id="verifying-function-arguments">Verifying function arguments</h3>

<p>This is mostly what comes to mind when someone refers to defensive programming. It means that a function should have defined behaviour for all possible inputs. If a function cannot handle an input, then it should throw an exception.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="java"><span class="c1">// no defensive programming</span>

    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">names</span><span class="o">;</span>
<span class="o">}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The problem above is that there are numerous opportunities for null pointer exceptions. In addition, we may get <code>null</code>s in our return list. An incorrect attempt at defensive programming may look like this:</p>

<p>Security in mobile games is usually left by the wayside. Usually, it’s just the lowest priority item on the list when it comes to getting a game out by a deadline. After the fact, you can ask anyone if the game should have security feature X and they’ll be shocked that it doesn’t already exist. Ask the same person before a deadline if you should have the same security feature, or a sparkling unicorn riding across the bottom of the settings page, and they’ll choose the sparking unicorn unless they’re a security nut.</p>

<p>This isn’t always entirely without merit. However, in the context of a real-time multiplayer game where players constantly interact with each other security becomes more important. You don’t want one bad seed ruining the experience for all the other players. Using HTTPS is one aspect that can improve the security of your game. We don’t need to buy an expensive certificate from a certificate authority either. If you’re distributing a mobile game you can distribute the certificate chain with the game.</p>

<h2 id="create-your-own-certificate-authority">Create your own certificate authority</h2>

<p>This is the part that I had the most trouble with. There are tutorials galore out there, however the ones I ran into failed to provide certificates that actually worked. Hopefully it can be a little easier for you. Use <a href="https://github.com/jsermeno/easycert_openssl.git">easycert openssl</a> on github to create your certificates.</p>

<p class="start_block">In the past I’ve been a big fan of PostgreSQL. It’s rock solid and performant. I’ve used it to scale to hundreds of thousands of users without even coming close to breaking a sweat. </p>

<p>The downside is that horizontal scaling is a pain. That typically means that you end up scaling vertically as long as you can. In addition, you don’t get availability and fault-tolerance for free. It requires extra time and work.</p>

<p>I wanted a database that emphasized availability, fault-tolerance, and scalability with little cost to the developer. As an indie game developer this may lead to reduced costs since an equivalent larger machine is usually much more expensive than several smaller machines. Riak’s masterless design was appealing to me, and it looked like it fit my needs better than anything else out there. Of course, when choosing a new technology there is always a chance you’ll regret it, but there is only one way to find out!</p>

<p>I found the documentation for Riak to be pretty good. However, there were a couple of gotchas. I found people with the same problem who were unable to find an answer around the various corners of google search, so I thought I’d make this short post on how to setup Riak from source.</p>

<p>You can refer to <a href="http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/ops/building/installing/mac-osx/#Installing-From-Source">Installing From Source</a> and the <a href="http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/quickstart/">Quickstart</a> from the Riak site for the most up to date versions and instructions. This post assumes you already have the Xcode tools from the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/">Apple Develop’s Website</a>.</p>

<p>Let’s get the source code.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="sh">wget http://s3.amazonaws.com/downloads.basho.com/riak/1.4/1.4.8/riak-1.4.8.tar.gz
tar zxvf riak-1.4.8.tar.gz
</code></pre></div>

<h2 id="build-erlang">Build Erlang</h2>

<p>Now we need to build it. This is where we’ll add a few additional steps. First, you need a specific version of Erlang (R15B01), and it also needs to be built as 64-bit. I’m using kerl to manage my erlang versions and it has been working out pretty great so far. It’s a simple version manager similar to nvm or rbenv for node and ruby respectively, if you have ever used those.</p>

<p class="date">- Mar 9, 2014 -</p>

<p class="start_block">I don’t believe that people ask <strong>why</strong> people play games often enough.</p>

<p>There is an extensive amount of material related to game design on the internet. Most of this material I have found falls broadly into one of two categories. The first category is bullet-point lists. These typically are one-size fits all recommendations based on observations from a successful game. These can be useful. We should always study and learn from the successes and failures around us. However, general recommendations usually fail to capture the complicated context in which they apply.</p>

<p>The second category is more useful and consists of in depth analysis about <strong>what</strong> design should be like, and how we can further improve the gaming experience for users. I personally want games to be of benefit to players, and find myself in disagreement with many of the mechanics that make it into today’s casual social games. However, much of the material that falls into this category fails to account for both what gamers consider a good game and why so many people also love casual social games. The explanation is often that casual social games are just plain manipulative. They are. But maybe there is something deeper that explains why people play these games.</p>

<h2 id="the-why-of-game-design">The Why of Game Design</h2>

<p>We need a new theory on game design that goes further than Minecraft good, Farmville bad. My view is that games are ultimately a reflection of the ideal world. Games fill some void that is present in reality and at any given time the perfect game allows a person to live the life they really want to live.</p>

<p>You might be thinking, <span class="quote">“Wait a minute! I don’t want to be pig farmer! And if you’re right I’ll just create a game where you have infinite fame and money and kill all enemies with the flick of a wrist. Muahahaha…”</span>.</p>

<p>People are more complex than that. The perfect world is not full of rainbows and lollipops where nothing goes wrong. That type of world may be fun for a short while, but I bet that most people would quickly become bored. Similarly, the ideal world for a person may have very little to do with their profession and surroundings. Although, I must admit that my favorite games have some sort of fantasy theme where I can beat down monsters with swords and magic.</p>

<p>So what is the ideal world? What life attributes are necessary for a person to be upon and their deathbed and confidently say that they led a life fulfilled and satisfied? It’s likely different for each and every person. However, there are certain qualities that many seek in their professional and personal lives that all common among the best games. I’ll update this list as I come across more qualities. For now, I believe that every human strives for challenge, progression, understanding, freedom, and socialization.</p>

<h2 id="challenge">Challenge</h2>

<p>Challenge is one of the most obvious aspects to any game. Even in the most vapid and humdrum games you must endure the mental challenge of patience. Otherwise the game would end instanteously. The challenge can also take on many other forms. It could be figuring out where to go next, solving a puzzle, finding out how fast you can button mash, or showing emotional resilience in the game that kills you 70 times a minute.</p>
